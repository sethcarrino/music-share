# React Music Share App
> Week 9 - Weekly Project - working with state, props, and forms to create an application that shares the song you are listening to or suggesting to other users.

## Overview 
> This weekly provided a few challenges as I am still new to understanding state and props at this point. I was able to work through the challenges and create a pretty cool looking product with bootstrap and CSS.
